AI Reflection
In the AI-generated descriptions, there's a clear difference between how the specific games (like "ANOTHER dress up sims OH NOES" or "Amazing Dress Up Philip Lester") and the dataset are presented. For the games, the AI focuses on the interactive, creative aspects, such as customizing outfits, framing them as personalized experiences meant for specific audiences like young players or fans.
In contrast, the dataset descriptions are more detached, emphasizing preservation and metadata (like titles, release dates, and genres), without exploring the personal or cultural significance of the games. The dataset acts as a structural catalog and lacks the deeper engagement with the games' cultural relevance, such as the fan communities or social dynamics surrounding them.
The AI’s language shows a subtle bias toward the technical and preservation aspects, treating the dataset as a neutral, static collection. This overlooks the power dynamics behind which games are included or excluded, what metadata is emphasized, and how the games are represented in a broader cultural context. For example, dress-up games, often aimed at young girls or fandoms, may be undervalued in archival efforts compared to "mainstream" or "serious" games, but the AI doesn’t address these inequalities.
Several key points are missing from the descriptions. The cultural impact or emotional significance of these games, like the connection between "Amazing Dress Up Philip Lester" and YouTube fan culture, is glossed over. The AI also doesn't critique gaps in the dataset, such as whether certain non-mainstream games or those from marginalized creators were excluded, reinforcing the idea that the dataset is complete and neutral when it's shaped by the biases of those who curate it.
Ultimately, the AI reinforces existing narratives about these games rather than challenging them. It treats the games as simple entertainment without exploring their roles in identity, fandom, or gender dynamics. There’s little critical reflection on the archival process or the power structures that influence how these games are remembered, missing an opportunity to bring fresh perspectives to the cultural significance of these games.
